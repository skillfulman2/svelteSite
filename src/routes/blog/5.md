There are a few simple pleasures that give me a strong appreciation for life's offerings:

- Walking outside after a strong rain with the suns rays poking through clouds
- Playing most games and sports
- Sitting down on the couch with a piping hot meal and watching Deal or no Deal after work

I live in a house with 2 other roomates: they are perfectly fine and we all get along well, however, when you put new things in any space you add entropy. This entropy manifests itself in many ways (as anybody with roomates can relate to) but the most problematic one is the dance that our TV remote makes in and out of this dimension. One moment its placed perfectly on our coffee table. Look away, look back, it's under/over/in/bewteen the couch.

In my perfect world I get home, make a nice meal, and turn on the TV. But heres the problem, that last part never happens without a couch cushion catastrophe or a crabwalk across the floor. And remember this is one of my simple pleasures that supposed to bring me quiet joy. Well 'nuffs e'nuff. My solution:

It's tough to misplace a table!!!!

Onward and Upward
